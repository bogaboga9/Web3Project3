			<p>First, I just wanna say, those brats next door are a total pain, but they are great customers.
			</p>
			<p>But on to me... Uhh, I love those Giants!</p>
			<p> I started this store because there wasn't enough Foreigner, Loverboy, or Boston
			on this internet thing that Frylock helped me get. I hate that I owe him a favor now.</p>
			<p>I sell those little smooth records, people now days call them CDs. And Frylock wanted MP Trees.
			Whatever, I don't know what trees have to do with music, but as long as people buy it, I sell it, just
			don't ask me where I get the stuff from. Trust me, you don't wanna know, you know?</p> 
			<p>Oh yeah, I also needed to supplement my income. Those Aqua Teen Menaces broke my pool, again!</p>
