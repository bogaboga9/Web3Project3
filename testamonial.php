			<p>While this site offers all of the most epic Rap that Master Shake can listen too,
			I have to say I hate Carl. He made the site so when I click on order, it is so slow, I have
			to click it over a million times. He has instructions, but who has time to read when they
			are epic like Master Shake? I got over a thousand copies of Jay-Z's "Magna Carta Holy Grail"!
			Now Carl loves me, but the Bank is knocking at the door for some reason. They don't know how
			credit cards work?"
